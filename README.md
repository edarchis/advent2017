These are my Advent of Code 2017 solutions in Kotlin.

I started programming as a kid in BASIC, then C, C++, Perl, Java, Groovy and this year I decided to learn Kotlin.
Prior to this challenge, I had never written a single line of Kotlin. So if you see something I did wrong or
could have improved, let me know.
